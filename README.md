Create a slider.

According to the requirements of the project, these are the controls that need to be implemented:

- Arrows (switch slides around the ring. That is, slide No. 3 will be followed by slide No. 1 again);
- Circles between the arrows (include the desired slide);
- Links at the top of the slider (include the desired slide).
